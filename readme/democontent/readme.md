# Demo Content

### Florista

There is now an extra, separate installation profile you can use if you want to set up a demo
site. This install profile has no extra steps, it just installs everything from Rocketship
and runs migrates to set up a premade homepage, blogs, contact pages, etc.

This profile should ONLY be used to showcase what a Rocketship site could look like with just some
minimal theming and site building, it is not meant to be a base to start building a new site on.

Drush d-set won't work if the site is installed with this profile, nor should it.

### Contents

This install profile sets up a homepage with a Hero image, USP, CTAs, and a fake Blog and Event view.
The fake Blog and Events may be replaced with actual blogs and events once we reach that step, but for now
they are simply all basic pages. We used Layout Builder to make some look more like a blog, others like events.

The overview pages are simply the reference block with manually selected basic pages.
