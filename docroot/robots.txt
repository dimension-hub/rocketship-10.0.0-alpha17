# This bit of text has been prepended by Dropsolid Rocketship.
# This is done automatically with core's scaffolding plugin and the
# settings for managing the scaffolding of the robots.txt file can be
# found in the toplevel composer.json file.
#
# The file you, as a developer, can change to add more text to the
# beginning of the robots.txt file can be found in the
# etc/scaffold-modifications/ folder.
#
# There is also an .append file for the robots.txt file you can use to
# append extra lines to the robots.txt file.

#
# robots.txt
#
# This file is to prevent the crawling and indexing of certain parts
# of your site by web crawlers and spiders run by sites like Yahoo!
# and Google. By telling these "robots" where not to go on your site,
# you save bandwidth and server resources.
#
# This file will be ignored unless it is at the root of your host:
# Used:    http://example.com/robots.txt
# Ignored: http://example.com/site/robots.txt
#
# For more information about the robots.txt standard, see:
