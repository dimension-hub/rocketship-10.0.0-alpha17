INTRODUCTION
------------

This module provides a way to bulk import redirects if you are using the
Redirect module (https://www.drupal.org/project/redirect).

The import is performed from an uploaded CSV file with the following structure:
'old url', 'new_url', 'redirect_code' = 301, 'language' = ''.
