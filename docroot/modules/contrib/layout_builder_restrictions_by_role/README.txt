Layout Builder Restrictions By Role

This is a plugin for the Layout Builder Restrictions module.

This plugin allows:

- restricting what roles can place what blocks, in all layouts, globally
- restricting what roles can use what layout, globally
- restricting what roles can place what blocks within each layout, globally
- the same as all the above, but then defined per view mode
