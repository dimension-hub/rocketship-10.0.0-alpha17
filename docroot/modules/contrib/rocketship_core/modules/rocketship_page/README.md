#Rocketship Page

Contains the Page content type, used for your static content from an "About 
us" page to a landingspage for a campaign.

This is the core of the Skeleton in many ways. It is very basic, but in 
combination with layout builder can be used for almost anything. In fact, 
every overview page are basic pages. The homepage, 404 and 403 are also basic pages.

This way the client has full control over metatags, page titles and the like.

Metatags is set up, RDF is set up. Path alias pattern uses the custom token 
from rocketship_core so nested pages' aliases follow the alias from the page 
above. 

Using layout builder and our bundled blocks the client can transform their basic pages 
into anything they desire.
