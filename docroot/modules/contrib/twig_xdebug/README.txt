INTRODUCTION
------------

This module enables you to use Xdebug breakpoints with Twig templates.

To use it, insert {{ breakpoint() }} into your template. When the processor
reaches that point, it makes a call to a Twig extension where xdebug_break() is
implemented.

The breakpoint will open in a file (BreakpointExtension.php) outside your Twig
template, but you'll be able to inspect any variables available at the
breakpoint in the template. The key values you'll see at the breakpoint are:

 - $context         These are the variables available to use in the template.
 - $environment     This is information about the Twig environment, including
                    available functions.
 - $arguments       If you supply an argument to breakpoint (e.g
                    {{ breakpoint(fields) }}), it'll be viewable here.
