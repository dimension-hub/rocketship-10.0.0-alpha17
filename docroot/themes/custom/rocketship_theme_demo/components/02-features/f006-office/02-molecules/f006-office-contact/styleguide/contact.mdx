# Office: contact

This is an example of a Feature Molecule (or Organism).<br />
It is also only available in the Drupal site when the Office feature is turned on and has a main office set.

For styling purposes, this component can be seen as a 'molecule' because it appears as a block inside of the doormat.<br />
So the component and its sass-files can be used as-is.<br />
However, this 'block' is an 'organism' in reality, because it is rendered using a view, <br />
containing a block (molecule) with multiple fields (and their own block wrappers for some reason). <br />
So the wrappers get very complex, very fast.<br />

**TO DO:** <br />
See later if we can split and simplify this when we built out the rest of the Features in the Styleguide.
