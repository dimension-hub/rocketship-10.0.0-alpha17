# Colors

Colors should be reusable as much as possible. The color palettes provided by the design, should be added to <br />
`00-theme/00-base/00-config/00-variables/_vars-00-colors.scss`

In order to preview them in the Styleguide, colors (variables + human readable names), should be added to `$defaultColors`.
