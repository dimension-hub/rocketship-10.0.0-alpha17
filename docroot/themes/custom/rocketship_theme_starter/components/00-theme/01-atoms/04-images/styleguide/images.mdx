## Iconfont

We use FontAwesome by default as an iconfont. <br />
Info on how the files are loaded or how to switch between free and paid versions can be found there but it works out-of-the-box. <br />
All you need to use it, is refer to the mixins under 00-theme/00-base/01-helpers/02-mixins/_mixins-typography.scss`<br />
and the many examples throughout the Sass-files.

## Custom icons as a fonts

### Requirements:
- Icons must be svg
- Icons must be perfectly aligned: no decimals in px values for left and top !!!
- Artboard must be perfectly sized: no decimals in width and height !!!

### Instructions:
- Add your svg's to the `icons` folder of the theme


- In your components-folder, look for `00-theme/05-pages/html/_html.twig` and add the iconfont name to `webfont_config_font_families` variable
- Refer to `00-base/01-helpers/02-mixins/_mixins-iconfont.scss` to use the iconfont
- Or refer to `00-base/01-helpers/02-mixins/_mixins-sprite.scss` to use the sprite

Use the Gulp command command line run `gulp icons:font` to generate the font<br />
The icons will be compiled into a font, located in `fonts/iconfont`

You will need to change the `$custom-icons` and `$custom-icons-type` variables in<br />
`00-theme/00-base/00-config/00-variables/_vars-base.scss`

As with other fonts, you will need to load the custom font in the html. <br />
Info on how to do that is located in the Base/Fonts documentation, in the styleguide.

Use the mixins of `00-base/01-helpers/02-mixins/_mixins-iconfont.scss` to use the iconfont

For the curious: [the technical details about how the sprite tasks works](https://www.liquidlight.co.uk/blog/creating-svg-sprites-using-gulp-and-sass/)


## Custom icons as sprite

Another option for using custom icons, is to use a sprite instead of a font.

Use the Gulp command `gulp icons:sprite`, which generates a sprite instead of a font.<br />
Just like with the custom font, it will generate variables and mixins in the components `00-base` folder.


### How to use

If you choose to use a sprite instead of an iconfont:<br />
The icons will be compiled into 1 font, located in `images/generated/sprite.svg`


We are using an SVG sprite generator (details in theme/icons/readme.md), <br />
which takes individual SVGs from `/icons` and generates `/images/sprite.svg`, when you run `gulp icons:sprite`

### Extra: inline usage

While it is possible to use an SVG sprite on an inline element in html, it's usually not practical in Drupal's Twig templates.
But if needed, you can use the `_icon.twig` component:<br />
The SVG component is found here: `/components/01-atoms/images/icons/_icon.twig`. <br />
See available variables in that file as well as instructions for Drupal.

Be advised this functionality remains untested and unsupported in this theme, so use at your own risk.<br />
Not all browsers can handle inline SVG and you will most likely have to include a polyfill<br />
(there is one via a library commented-out in the component), as well test for this chrome bug:

#### Examples of usage below:

Simple: (no BEM renaming)

```
{% include "@atoms/images/icons/_icon.twig" with {
  icon_name: 'menu',
} %}
```

... creates...

```
<svg class="icon">
  <use xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="/icons.svg#src--menu"></use>
</svg>
```

Complex (BEM classes):

```
{% include "@atoms/04-images/icons/_icon.twig" with {
  icon_bem_block: 'main-nav',
  icon_bem_element: 'toggle',
  icon_name: 'menu',
} %}
```

... creates...

```
<svg class="main-nav__toggle">
  <use xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="/icons.svg#src--menu"></use>
</svg>
```

## Responsive images

You will see during Drupal sitebuilding, that you can attach image styles to an image field, via its formatter.<br />
Usually, you will want to pick a 'responsive image style'. <br />
This is basically a collection of normal image styles but you tell it on what specific one to load per breakpoint. <br />

In Rocketship, there are already a lot of normal image styles (/admin/config/media/image-styles) available for you<br />
to compose your own responsive image styles (scaling but also cropping of all well-know ratios, like 3:2, 16:9, â€¦)<br />
And there are some responsive image styles(/admin/config/media/responsive-image-style) available as well <br />
(depending on what Rocketship Features and Paragraphs you installed).

Additionally, we have another formatter called `drimage`, which automatically generates responsive image styles for you, based on a preset ratio or scaling.  
So you have less work setting things up. It is used in the 'image' Media Type view modes, which various Content Blocks use to display images.

In Storybook, the 'Responsive Image' and 'Blazy Responsive Image' show you what that would look like.<br />
The main difference with the actual Drupal output, is that the Storybook components use the `img` tag with a `srcset` attribute, <br />
while Drupal uses a `picture` tag with `source` tags inside of it per image style.<br />
We've chosen the simplified output in Storybook because visually the result is identical <br />
and there is already a high complexity to the Storybook image components. <br />
_(eg. already lots of nested templates and source_attributes don't render automatically)_


## Lazy loading

To optimize the loading of images in Rocketship, we have used several formatters and modules, however, these give inconsistent results when it comes to (lazy) loading images.  
For example: 
- Blazy tends to regularly break and only load the xs image
- drimage handles lazy loading very well but doesn't have a preloader

For this reason, we've added a custom solution that applies lazy loading on ALL images we could find, with a unified styling of the preloader.  
So regular image styles, responsive images (using picture tag), blazy and drimage will show the same preloader (even if they don't all use the same system for lazy loading).

- Normally, Drupal Core 9.1+ will print the `loading` property as part of image attributes. If it doesn't, you can use `TEMPLATE_preprocess_HOOK` functions to force it. See the `image_preprocess` and `field_preprocess` hooks in the `.theme` file for existing examples.  
- The twig files responsible for handling the `img` tag will print this attribute. Eg. `04-images/00-image/_image.twig` and any file that includes this template (like `_picture.twig`)
- **If you want to add lazy loading for browsers that don't support it natively** you HAVE to turn the fallback on in the theme settings in the admin pages: `/admin/appearance/settings/NAME_OF_YOUR_THEME` 
  - this setting will replace `src` with `data-src` so the JS fallback can get to work.
  - this also means that on browsers with native support, loading goes a bit slower (because the JS does the detection + performs actions, instead of the browser handling it)
- `images.js` located in the `04-images/00-image` folder, contains the helper code. This will:
  - stop the preloader effect on img tags with `loading="lazy"` on them by adding a class `js-lazy-loaded` on its parent wrapper.
  - (optionally) fall back to non-native loading: checks images with the lazy loading attribute + `data-src` and load them when they become visible (using an observer)
- `_image.scss` located in that same folder, will apply styling on an `img` wrapper, that creates a preloader using pseudo-elements.
  - for Blazy: since it has its own formatter logic, and already has its own preloader, we override that specific styling without relying on our custom loading logic.
  - for drimage: we use the `.drimage` wrapper for applying the preloader styling

The `img`-tag gets a wrapper called `lazy-wrapper` (or we use the `.drimage` wrapper), which uses pseudo-elements to append an animated preloader.  
When the image is done loading, the class `js-lazy-loaded` is added to the wrapper and the preloader disappears.  
So the preloader is fully customizable via the theming layer, by either changing the styling (.scss) or changing the behavior (in .js).  
Or as a last resort, by using preprocess hooks to change the relevant attribute(s).

Be aware that there is a chance the loaded image remains undetected, depending on inconsistent browser implementation or JS issues.  
Which is why the preloader is small and has a negative index, so it disappears behind the loaded image if the class doesn't appear.  
So keep your custom preloader small and unobtrusive, if you plan on customizing it.

For use in Storybook, take a look at the image yml files and you'll see a new attribute called `image_loading` that's responsible for printing the right props and classes.  
Alternatively, you could add 'loading' to the image 'attributes' object. The first option is just a cleaner/more direct way to do it for components.

## Blazy

In Drupal we can choose to use this module to lazy load images, per image field, using the blazy formatter. <br />
Just like with a normal image field, you also need to pick an image style (or responsive image style)<br />
but the front-end will also output some extra classes and wrappers.<br />

We have faked this functionality within the Blazy Image and Blazy Responsive Image components so you can see the image preloader in action.<br />
The `blazy.load.js`-file simply uses a timeout to delay loading the image source, so you can see the preloader a little longer.<br />
To increase the delay or make other changes to help your theming, edit that javascript-file.
